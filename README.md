## Smart Spawner - GUI Spawner Plugin ✨ v1.2.1-DEV
This plugin is a fork of the original Smart Spawner plugin by [ptthanh02](https://github.com/ptthanh02). With the purpose of converting from [Spigot API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/) to [Paper API](https://papermc.io/javadocs) to support [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) and [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia) servers at the same time and improve performance on these 2 platforms. Only use in production if you are confident in the stability of the plugin.
